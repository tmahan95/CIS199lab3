Create and test a Windows Forms application that serves as a tip calculator. The user will enter the price of their meal and the application will calculate tips for 15%, 18%, and 20%. Specifically, the application must have:
A Form titled "Lab 3". Remember, the form's Text property controls the information displayed in the form's title bar.
A Label titled "Enter price of meal:" next to a TextBox that will gather this information from the user.
Labels for "15%", "18%", and "20%" next to output Labels. Remember, for output labels, you'll need to change the AutoSize and BorderStyle properties (as the text does in Tutorial 3-3).
A Button titled "Calculate Tip" with an event handler that calculates and displays the three tip amounts using currency formatting (again as in Tutorial 3-3). Remember, magic numbers are to be avoided. Use named constants, such as TIPRATE instead of literals like .15, or .18m, etc. See Section 3.8 for how to do this.
All controls should be renamed from the defaults (label1, button1, etc.) to have descriptive names.
